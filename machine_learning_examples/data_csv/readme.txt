___Data information___

- The output we wish to predict is in "y":
	y: miles per gallon

- Each row in "X" contains seven numbers. These numbers are scaled and should be used for your experiments. The original numbers are in "X_orig". The 7 columns of "X" correspond to:
	x1: intercept term
	x2: number of cylinders
	x3: displacement
	x4: horsepower
	x5: weight
	x6: acceleration
	x7: model year

- "legend" contains car name for each entry of y and row of X
- "X_orig" contains the original, unscaled numbers for those interested. This matrix is not necessary for completing the homework.
